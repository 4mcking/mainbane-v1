# 🌌 Mainbrane V1 – The Beautiful Hive Mind

Welcome to **Mainbrane** — a creative-tech initiative and personal portfolio born from mind, memory, and meaning. This is **Version 1** of the Mainbrane website — the genesis build representing our core vision, structure, and purpose.

> _“Future written in the stars, best believe in who you are.”_

Mainbrane V1 is a minimalist yet bold, single-page portfolio site that introduces the **Mainbrane ecosystem** — a convergence of tech, music, writing, and experimental design. Built with **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JS**, it captures the essence of our brand and story.
